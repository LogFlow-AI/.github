# 🚀 LogFlowAI: AI-Driven Proactive DevOps 🚀  

Welcome to **LogFlowAI**, an AI-powered StatML DevOps platform that transforms system monitoring from **reactive troubleshooting** to **proactive intelligence**. Originally conceived at **HackMIT 2023**, where it secured **3rd place in the Y Combinator Startup Challenge**, LogFlowAI was further developed into a tangible product at **TreeHacks 2025**—all within an intense **16-hour sprint**!  

## 🔥 What is LogFlowAI?  
LogFlowAI is a next-gen **log intelligence** and **predictive analytics** platform that:  
✅ **Ingests & Processes Logs in Real-Time**: Handles Kubernetes, JSON endpoints, CSV files, and syslogs with sub-second latency.  
✅ **Predicts & Prevents Failures**: Leverages neural networks and HDFS trace benchmarks to identify anomalies before they escalate.  
✅ **Automates Incident Reports**: Uses **LangChain-powered AI** to transform raw log data into **prescriptive**, **human-readable** insights.  
✅ **Scales Seamlessly**: Built with **FastAPI, Django, PyTorch, Docker, NVIDIA Brev**, and cloud-native technologies for low-latency inference and enterprise-ready deployment.
